# Portfolio React

## Description

This React Portfolio is a single-page application designed to showcase web development projects in a modern and interactive format. Tailored for developers seeking to highlight their work to employers or collaborators, it leverages React to offer a dynamic user experience unlike traditional portfolios. Deployed on Netlify, it presents a seamless way to display a developer's skills, projects, and professional informationâ€”all in one place.
